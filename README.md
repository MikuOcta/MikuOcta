Hello! I am Octavian (or Miku for short) :D

I am a ENTP Drama queen and a tech enthusiast that likes everything Linux and open-source.

Previous core founder of Crystal Linux.

Being a big RedHat fan, my favourite distros are RHEL and Fedora but I also like elementaryOS (running now Silverblue 36)

Now I am learning Vala, Ansible automation and system managment.

I also like playing with podman containers and kubernetes.

If you want to contact me, add me on Discord! MikuOcta22#3705

I wish you have an awesome day! XOXO
